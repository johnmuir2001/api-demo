# React API Challenge

The Challenge is to get data from an API and display it in a React app, you must:
* Fetch data from an API
* Store the returned data in the state as an array
* Map through the state array, rendering a component that gets passed the API data
* When you click on a piece of rendered data it opens a modal that contains more information about what you clicked on - you can create your own modal or use the react modal package (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-modal>)

If the goals have been met then try to add the following features:
* Create your own modal that closes when you click off of it (may require the useRef hook)
* See if you can add a sort option to orgainse you data e.g alphabetically asc, alphabetically desc, number inc, number desc etc.
